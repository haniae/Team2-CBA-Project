# BenchmarkOS Chatbot Platform

BenchmarkOS is an institutional-grade copilot for finance teams. It pairs deterministic market analytics with a conversational interface so analysts can ask natural-language questions, inspect lineage, and keep data pipelines auditable.

## Practicum context

This repository underpins our Fall 2025 DNSC 6317 practicum at The George Washington University, where we are building and governing an explainable finance copilot that can support regulated teams. Our objectives include stress-testing BenchmarkOS against real analyst workflows, documenting orchestration strategies for enterprise rollouts, and demonstrating responsible AI guardrails around data access, lineage, and scenario planning.

### Team

- Hania A.
- Van Nhi Vuong
- Malcolm Muoriyarwa
- Devarsh Patel
- Supervising faculty: Professor Patrick Hall (The George Washington University)

### Project focus

- Translate classroom techniques into a production-grade analytics assistant that blends deterministic KPI calculations with auditable LLM experiences.
- Stand up KPI coverage pipelines that stay resilient when market data lags or filing assumptions drift.
- Deliver practitioner-ready documentation, including deployment runbooks and testing strategies, so stakeholders can re-create the practicum outcomes after the semester concludes.

## User story and pain points

Picture a Monday 8 a.m. stand-up in GW's practicum lab. Hania, acting as the analytics lead at a mid-sized asset manager, receives an urgent request from Van Nhi, who plays the portfolio strategist responsible for deciding which industrial names to overweight this quarter. Malcolm, the risk officer, wants to confirm that every metric driving the recommendation can be traced back to a filing or price feed, while Devarsh, modeling the compliance analyst, needs evidence that no unvetted prompt will expose sensitive data. Before BenchmarkOS, the team burned hours stitching CSVs from EDGAR, refreshing brittle spreadsheets, and copy-pasting numbers into chat threads-introducing latency, version drift, and audit nightmares. With the chatbot, they ask "Compare RTX and LMT revenue trajectories post-2022" and receive deterministic KPIs, lineage breadcrumbs, and warnings when data freshness slips. The story mirrors the real stakeholders we observed during practicum interviews: analysts juggling multiple tickers, risk partners demanding reproducibility, and compliance leaders seeking transparent guardrails. BenchmarkOS exists to calm that Monday chaos by fusing reliable data pipelines with an explainable conversational layer.

| Main group | Sub-group | Role / examples | Goals when using chatbot | Current pain points | Key needs from chatbot |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Financial industry (professional users) | CFO / FP&A / IR | CFOs, finance directors, investor relations leads | Generate peer comparisons in minutes; ensure KPI standardisation and source traceability | Data collection and reconciliation takes 3–5 days; KPI definitions drift; no audit trail for the board | Peer packets in under five minutes; standardised KPI dictionary with lineage; export-ready reports |
| Corporate development / M&A teams | Corporate development, strategy, M&A analysts | Benchmark targets quickly for acquisitions; compare competitors by segment and geography | Manual benchmarking is slow; limited ability to expand peer sets | Dynamic peer set management; audit trail per KPI; override controls for peers, KPIs, and timeframes |
| Consulting and advisory | Consulting analysts, advisory teams | Deliver rapid, credible benchmarks; produce slide-ready, verifiable outputs | Data gathering and normalisation are time-consuming; clients question credibility without lineage | KPI metrics with click-through lineage; segment normalisation; multi-dimensional benchmarking |
| Non-financial users (non-professional) | Business decision makers | CEOs, COOs, heads of strategy | See competitor and market context without deep finance expertise; decide quickly | Financial data feels complex; no time to compute KPIs; reports lack actionable insights | Strategic summaries tied to KPIs; clear visuals; action-oriented insights |
| Students and learners | Students, researchers, MBA learners | Learn to read 10-K/10-Q filings; understand KPI calculations | Unsure how to compute KPIs; do not know reliable data sources | Step-by-step KPI explanations; guided drill-down from KPI to tables to source filings |
| Semi-professional users | Investors and analysts | Buy-side and sell-side analysts, individual investors | Make faster investment calls with peer benchmarks | Hard to compare multiple companies quickly; limited reliable data sources | Dynamic peer comparisons by ticker; exportable reports; transparent source traceability |

## Overview

BenchmarkOS ships as a batteries-included template for building finance copilots. Out of the box you gain:

- Durable storage (SQLite by default, PostgreSQL optional) for conversations, facts, metrics, audit trails, and scenarios.
- Analytics engines that normalise SEC filings, hydrate them with market quotes, and expose tabular as well as scenario-ready metrics.
- Flexible LLM integration with a deterministic echo model for testing or OpenAI for production deployments.
- Multi-channel experiences (CLI REPL, FastAPI REST service, single-page web UI) so you can prototype quickly and scale later.
- Rich documentation (docs/orchestration_playbook.md) that explains how to scale "any company" requests and replicate the workflows in production.

## Core capabilities

- **Multi-channel chat** – run_chatbot.py offers a REPL, serve_chatbot.py (or uvicorn) exposes REST endpoints, and webui/ renders a browser client complete with live status indicators.
- **Deterministic analytics** – AnalyticsEngine calculates primary/secondary metrics, growth rates, valuation multiples, and derived KPIs from the latest filings and quotes.
- **Incremental ingestion** – data_ingestion.py and helper scripts pull SEC EDGAR facts, Yahoo quotes, and optional Bloomberg feeds with retry/backoff.
- **Audit-ready storage** – database.py writes metric snapshots, raw financial facts, audit events, and full chat history for compliance reviews.
- **Extensible LLM layer** – toggle between the local echo model and OpenAI via LLM_PROVIDER, or extend llm_client.py for other vendors.
- **Task orchestration hooks** – tasks.py provides a queue abstraction you can plug into ingestion or long-running commands.

## Architecture map

See docs/architecture.md for the component diagram. The latest revision includes the structured parsing pipeline (alias_builder.py, parse.py, time_grammar.py) and the retrieval layer that feeds grounded artefacts into the LLM alongside the existing CLI, FastAPI, analytics, and ingestion components.

## Retrieval & ML internals

BenchmarkOS combines deterministic data prep with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) so every answer traces back to persisted facts.

### Natural-language parsing (deterministic)

- src/benchmarkos_chatbot/parsing/alias_builder.py loads a generated aliases.json covering the S&P 500. It normalises free-text mentions, resolves ticker aliases, applies manual overrides (Alphabet, Berkshire share classes, JP Morgan, AT&T), and when needed performs a fuzzy fallback and emits warnings.
- parse_to_structured in parsing/parse.py orchestrates alias resolution, metric synonym detection, and the flexible time grammar (time_grammar.py). It returns a strict JSON intent schema that downstream planners consume and store (conversation.last_structured_response["parser"]).

### Retrieval layer (RAG)

- Structured intents route directly into AnalyticsEngine, which reads metric snapshots, KPI overrides, and fact tables from SQLite/Postgres.
- Retrieved artefacts (tables, benchmark comparisons, audit trails) become RAG "system" messages that condition the LLM, ensuring no fabricated values slip through.

### Generation / machine learning

- llm_client.py abstracts provider selection (local echo vs. OpenAI). The model verbalises retrieved metrics, summarises trends, and surfaces parser warnings.
- Scenario and benchmarking flows blend deterministic calculations (growth rates, spreads) with LLM narration, preserving numeric accuracy while keeping explanations natural.

### Tooling & coverage

Regenerate the alias universe with:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=./src
python scripts/generate_aliases.py
```

The script reads data/tickers/universe_sp500.txt, applies the same normalisation rules as runtime, and rewrites aliases.json with coverage stats.

Guardrails live in tests/test_alias_resolution.py, tests/test_time_grammar.py, and tests/test_nl_parser.py, ensuring alias coverage, period parsing, and structured intents stay within spec.

## Quick start

### 2. Configure environment defaults

Open .env and update database paths, API keys, and provider toggles. Prefer not to store an OpenAI key in the repo? Put it in ~/.config/benchmarkos-chatbot/openai_api_key and the loader will pick it up automatically.

### 3. (Optional) Warm the datastore

SQLite tables are created lazily, but you can preload metrics with:

```bash
python scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py --years 5 --chunk-size 25 --sleep 2 --resume
```

This pulls the sample watch list, respects SEC rate limits, and writes audit events.

## Running the chatbot

### CLI REPL

```bash
python run_chatbot.py
```

Inside the prompt, type help to see available commands. Common examples:

| Command | Example | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| metrics | metrics AAPL 2022-2024 | Latest and historical KPI block for one ticker. |
| compare | compare MSFT NVDA 2023 | Side-by-side metrics table. |
| table | table TSLA metrics revenue net_income | Renders a low-level ASCII table (useful in tests). |
| fact | fact AMZN 2023 revenue | Inspect a normalised financial fact. |
| scenario | scenario GOOGL bull rev=+8% mult=+0.5 | Run a what-if scenario with metric deltas. |
| ingest | ingest SHOP 5 | Trigger live ingestion (SEC, Yahoo, optional Bloomberg). |

Comparison responses append an "S&P 500 Avg" column highlighting how each ticker stacks up on margins, ROE, and valuation multiples.

### FastAPI + SPA

```bash
python serve_chatbot.py --port 8000
# or run the ASGI app directly
uvicorn benchmarkos_chatbot.web:app --reload --port 8000
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000. The SPA exposes:

- Real-time request timeline (intent, cache, context, compose) with slow-step hints.
- Export shortcuts (CSV, PDF) and in-line benchmarks.
- Settings panel to toggle data sources, timeline detail, and export defaults.

### REST endpoints

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| POST | /chat | Submit a prompt. Returns reply, conversation_id, structured artefacts, and progress events. |
| GET | /metrics | Retrieve numeric metrics for one or more tickers (start_year / end_year filters supported). |
| GET | /facts | Fetch normalised financial facts backing the numbers. |
| GET | /audit | View the latest ingestion/audit events for a ticker. |
| GET | /health | Basic readiness/liveness check for load balancers. |

The /chat response includes structured extras (highlights, trends, comparison_table, citations, exports, conclusion) so downstream integrations can reuse the analytics without re-parsing text.

## Data ingestion playbooks

### On-demand

AnalyticsEngine.get_metrics calls ingest_live_tickers when it detects missing coverage. You can route this through tasks.TaskManager to queue and monitor ingestion jobs—see inline docstrings for patterns.

### Batch scripts

| Script | When to use it | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py | Refresh a watch list with resume support and polite rate limiting. | python scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py --universe sp500 --years 10 --chunk-size 25 --sleep 2 --resume |
| scripts/ingestion/batch_ingest.py | Pull the built-in mega-cap list through ingest_live_tickers with retry/backoff. | python scripts/ingestion/batch_ingest.py |
| scripts/ingestion/ingest_companyfacts.py | Mirror SEC companyfacts into Postgres (configure SEC_TICKERS and PG* env vars). | SEC_TICKERS=MSFT,AAPL PGHOST=localhost python scripts/ingestion/ingest_companyfacts.py |
| scripts/ingestion/ingest_frames.py | Download SEC data frames for benchmarking in Postgres. | SEC_TICKERS=MSFT,AAPL python scripts/ingestion/ingest_frames.py |
| scripts/ingestion/load_prices_stooq.py | Backfill prices from Stooq when Yahoo throttles. | SEC_TICKERS=MSFT,AAPL python scripts/ingestion/load_prices_stooq.py |

All scripts honour the configuration from load_settings() and write audit events so the chatbot can justify sourcing decisions.

### Price-refresh workflow

Use this to keep price-driven ratios current without re-ingesting everything:

```bash
pip install yfinance  # one-time
$env:SEC_TICKERS = (Get-Content data/tickers/universe_sp500.txt) -join ','
# Optional Postgres target
$env:PGHOST='127.0.0.1'; $env:PGPORT='5432'
$env:PGDATABASE='secdb'; $env:PGUSER='postgres'; $env:PGPASSWORD='hania123'
python scripts/ingestion/load_prices_yfinance.py

$env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path .\src).Path
python - <<'PY'
from benchmarkos_chatbot.config import load_settings
from benchmarkos_chatbot.analytics_engine import AnalyticsEngine
AnalyticsEngine(load_settings()).refresh_metrics(force=True)
PY
```

Restart serve_chatbot.py afterwards so the SPA sees the refreshed metrics.

## Ingest and quote loading (English quick guide)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Create/activate venv and install deps:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # PowerShell: .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -e .
  ```
- Optional but recommended for SEC: set a descriptive User-Agent (not a token):
  ```bash
  export SEC_API_USER_AGENT="BenchmarkOSBot/1.0 (you@example.com)"
  ```

### Ingest the S&P 500 into SQLite

SQLite path defaults to data/sqlite/benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3 (configurable via DATABASE_PATH).

Pick one of the following forms (both equivalent if you ran pip install -e .).

Module form:
```bash
python -m scripts.ingestion.ingest_universe --universe sp500 --years 10 --chunk-size 25 --sleep 2
```

Script path form:
```bash
python scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py --universe sp500 --years 10 --chunk-size 25 --sleep 2
```

Notes:

- --years 10 pulls the most recent 10 fiscal years (cutoff = current_year - years + 1).
- The job uses a progress file .ingestion_progress.json so re-runs can --resume where they left off.
- If you see "Nothing to do" but the DB is empty, delete the progress file and re-run:
  ```bash
  rm -f .ingestion_progress.json
  ```

Verify counts:

```python
python - <<'PY'
import sqlite3, json
p='data/sqlite/benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3'
con=sqlite3.connect(p)
print(json.dumps({t: con.execute('select count(*) from '+t).fetchone()[0] for t in [
  'financial_facts','company_filings','market_quotes','metric_snapshots','audit_events','ticker_aliases'
]}, indent=2))
PY
```

### Load market quotes (so price-based ratios populate)

Load via Yahoo Finance in batches to avoid rate limits. Example: load all tickers already present in the DB, 50 per batch:

```python
python - <<'PY'
import os, time, sqlite3, subprocess
db='data/sqlite/benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3'
con=sqlite3.connect(db)
tickers=[r[0] for r in con.execute("SELECT DISTINCT ticker FROM financial_facts ORDER BY ticker")]
BATCH=50
for i in range(0,len(tickers),BATCH):
    os.environ['SEC_TICKERS']=",".join(tickers[i:i+BATCH])
    subprocess.run(['python','-m','scripts.ingestion.load_prices_yfinance'], check=False)
    time.sleep(1)
print('Done.')
PY
```

Then refresh analytics snapshots to recalculate P/E, EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, TSR, etc. with the latest prices:

```python
python - <<'PY'
from benchmarkos_chatbot.config import load_settings
from benchmarkos_chatbot.analytics_engine import AnalyticsEngine
AnalyticsEngine(load_settings()).refresh_metrics(force=True)
print('Refreshed metric_snapshots.')
PY
```

Check the latest quote timestamp:

```python
python - <<'PY'
import sqlite3
con=sqlite3.connect('data/sqlite/benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3')
print('quotes=',con.execute('select count(*) from market_quotes').fetchone()[0])
print('latest=',con.execute('select max(quote_time) from market_quotes').fetchone()[0])
PY
```

### Windows notes (PowerShell)

- Activate:  .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
- Use the script path variant if python -m complains about imports:
  ```bash
  python scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py --universe sp500 --years 10 --chunk-size 25 --sleep 2
  ```
- If you see ModuleNotFoundError: benchmarkos_chatbot, ensure you ran pip install -e . or set:
  ```bash
  $env:PYTHONPATH = (Resolve-Path .\src).Path
  ```

### Common issues

- "Nothing to do" with --resume: delete .ingestion_progress.json and re-run.
- Yahoo 429: reduce batch size (env YAHOO_QUOTE_BATCH_SIZE) and add small sleeps; retry.
- DB path: override with DATABASE_PATH if you don't want the default under data/sqlite/.

### Coverage universe

docs/ticker_names.md lists every tracked company (482 tickers at generation time). Regenerate it—and keep the parser aligned—whenever the universe changes:

```bash
$env:SEC_TICKERS = (Get-Content data/tickers/universe_sp500.txt) -join ','
python - <<'PY'
import os
from pathlib import Path
import yfinance as yf
root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
tickers = [
    line.strip()
    for line in (root / "data" / "tickers" / "universe_sp500.txt").read_text().splitlines()
    if line.strip()
]
pairs = []
for ticker in tickers:
    name = None
    try:
        info = yf.Ticker(ticker).info
        name = info.get("longName") or info.get("shortName")
    except Exception:
        name = None
    if not name:
        name = ticker
    pairs.append((ticker, name))
out = root / "docs" / "ticker_names.md"
out.write_text("## Coverage Universe\n\n" + "\n".join(f"- {name} ({ticker})" for ticker, name in pairs), encoding="utf-8")
print(f"Updated {out}")
PY
```

To refresh aliases at the same time:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=./src
python scripts/generate_aliases.py
```

## Configuration reference

load_settings() reads environment variables (or .env) and provides sensible defaults.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| DATABASE_TYPE | sqlite | Switch to postgresql for shared deployments. |
| DATABASE_PATH | ./data/sqlite/benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3 | SQLite file location; created automatically. |
| POSTGRES_HOST, POSTGRES_PORT, POSTGRES_DATABASE, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD | unset | Required when DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql; POSTGRES_SCHEMA overrides the default sec. |
| LLM_PROVIDER | local | local uses the deterministic echo model; set to openai for real completions. |
| OPENAI_MODEL | gpt-4o-mini | Passed verbatim to the OpenAI Chat Completions API. |
| SEC_API_USER_AGENT | BenchmarkOSBot/1.0 (support@benchmarkos.com) | Mandatory for SEC EDGAR requests. Customize it for your org. |
| EDGAR_BASE_URL | https://data.sec.gov | Override if you proxy or mirror EDGAR. |
| YAHOO_QUOTE_URL | https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/quote | Used to refresh quotes. |
| YAHOO_QUOTE_BATCH_SIZE | 50 | Maximum tickers per Yahoo batch. |
| HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT | 30 | Seconds before HTTP clients give up. |
| INGESTION_MAX_WORKERS | 8 | Thread pool size for ingestion routines. |
| DATA_CACHE_DIR | ./cache | Stores downloaded filings, facts, and progress markers. |
| ENABLE_BLOOMBERG | false | Toggle Bloomberg ingestion; requires host/port/timeout values. |
| BLOOMBERG_HOST, BLOOMBERG_PORT, BLOOMBERG_TIMEOUT | unset | Only used if Bloomberg is enabled. |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | unset | Looked up in env, then keyring, then ~/.config/benchmarkos-chatbot/openai_api_key. |

Secrets belong in your local .env. Windows developers can rely on keyring so API keys live outside the repo.

## Database schema

BenchmarkOS intentionally supports two storage backends, but your deployment uses only one at a time—by default it's SQLite:

- **SQLite (default / implied in this repo)** – shipping the database as a file keeps setup frictionless for development, tests, and CI. All conversations, metrics, and audit events live in the path defined by DATABASE_PATH. For this reason, the stock .env (and most tests such as test_ingestion_perf.py) run purely on SQLite. It was chosen because it "just works": no external server to provision, a trivial backup story, and fast enough for single-user workflows. PRAGMAs (WAL, synchronous=NORMAL, temp_store=MEMORY, cache_size=-16000) are applied automatically so sustained writes remain smooth.
- **PostgreSQL (optional)** – the same helper module can target Postgres when you set DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql and supply the POSTGRES_* DSN variables. Teams switch to Postgres when chat sessions are shared across analysts, when concurrency or replication matters, or when governance requires managed backups. If you haven't changed those settings, Postgres is unused.

In other words, you are currently using a single database—SQLite—because it was selected for simplicity and portability. The PostgreSQL path is documented for teams that choose to run BenchmarkOS in a multi-user/shared environment later.

Regardless of backend, both share the same schema:

### Key tables:

| Table | Purpose | Notable columns |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| conversations | Stores chat turns for resumable threads. | conversation_id, role, content, created_at |
| cached_prompts | Deduplicates prompts so identical requests reuse cached replies. | prompt_hash, payload, created_at, reply |
| metric_snapshots | Persisted analytics snapshot consumed by the chatbot/UI. | ticker, metric, period, value, start_year, end_year, updated_at, source |
| company_filings | Metadata for SEC filings pulled during ingestion. | ticker, accession_number, form_type, filed_at, data |
| financial_facts | Normalised SEC fact rows (revenues, margins, etc.). | ticker, metric, fiscal_year, period, value, unit, source_filing, raw |
| market_quotes | Latest quotes from Yahoo/Bloomberg/Stooq loaders. | ticker, price, currency, timestamp, source |
| kpi_values | KPI backfill overrides that smooth derived metrics. | ticker, fiscal_year, fiscal_quarter, metric_id, value, method, warning |
| audit_events | Traceability for ingestion and scenario runs. | ticker, event_type, entity_id, details, created_at |
| ticker_aliases | Maps tickers to CIK/company names to speed ingestion. | ticker, cik, company_name, updated_at |

On startup database.initialise() applies schema migrations idempotently. When running in SQLite mode the PRAGMAs mentioned above are applied automatically; switching to Postgres only requires setting the DSN variables—the rest of the code paths remain identical.

## File reference

### Root scripts & helpers

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| scripts/utility/main.py | Rich CLI wrapper exposing metrics/table commands, abbreviations, and scenario helpers. |
| run_chatbot.py | Lightweight REPL entry point that calls BenchmarkOSChatbot.create(). |
| serve_chatbot.py | Convenience launcher for the FastAPI app (src/benchmarkos_chatbot/web.py). |
| scripts/ingestion/batch_ingest.py | Loads the curated watch list with retry/backoff. |
| scripts/ingestion/ingest_universe.py | Batch ingester with resume support; refreshes metrics after each chunk. |
| scripts/ingestion/ingest_frames.py | Downloads SEC data frames into Postgres for benchmarking. |
| scripts/ingestion/load_prices_stooq.py | Imports Stooq prices as a fallback when Yahoo throttles. |
| scripts/generate_aliases.py | Regenerates the S&P 500 alias universe (aliases.json). |
| requirements.txt | Runtime dependency lockfile. |
| pyproject.toml | Project metadata, dependencies, and pytest configuration (adds src/ to PYTHONPATH). |

### Parsing & retrieval components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| parsing/alias_builder.py | Normalises company mentions, loads alias sets, applies overrides, and resolves tickers with fuzzy fallbacks. |
| parsing/aliases.json | Generated alias universe consumed at runtime. |
| parsing/parse.py | Converts prompts into structured intents (tickers, metrics, periods, warnings). |
| parsing/time_grammar.py | Flexible period parser covering fiscal/calendar ranges, lists, quarters, and relative windows. |

### Parser-focused tests

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| tests/test_alias_resolution.py | Validates alias coverage, manual overrides, fuzzy warnings, and ordering. |
| tests/test_time_grammar.py | Ensures the time grammar handles ranges, lists, quarter formats, and two-digit years. |
| tests/test_nl_parser.py | End-to-end structured intent checks for compare/trend prompts and parser warnings. |

### Web assets

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| webui/app.js | SPA logic, progress timeline updates, settings panel, and chat interactions. |
| webui/styles.css | Styling for the SPA (dark/light friendly, timeline badges, typography). |
| webui/static/data/*.json | Precompiled KPI library and company universe metadata. |

## Quality and testing

- Run the suite: `pytest`
- Parser & alias focus: `pytest tests/test_alias_resolution.py tests/test_time_grammar.py tests/test_nl_parser.py`
- Target a single test: `pytest tests/test_cli_tables.py::test_table_command_formats_rows`
- Manual sanity: point LLM_PROVIDER=local to avoid burning API credits during smoke tests.
- Database reset: delete benchmarkos_chatbot.sqlite3 and rerun ingestion—migrations run automatically on startup.

CI isn't configured by default, but pytest -ra (preconfigured in pyproject.toml) surfaces skipped/xfail tests neatly. Consider adding ruff or black once your team standardises formatting.

## Troubleshooting

- "OpenAI API key not found" – set OPENAI_API_KEY, store it via keyring, or create ~/.config/benchmarkos-chatbot/openai_api_key.
- WinError 10048 when starting the server – another process is on the port. Run Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000 and terminate it, or start with --port 8001.
- Yahoo Finance 429 errors – lower YAHOO_QUOTE_BATCH_SIZE, add delays between runs, or temporarily use scripts/ingestion/load_prices_stooq.py.
- PostgreSQL auth failures – confirm SSL/network settings, then double-check POSTGRES_* vars; the DSN is logged at debug level when DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql is active.
- Pytest cannot locate modules – run from the repo root so the pythonpath = ["src", "."] entry in pyproject.toml kicks in.

## Further reading

- docs/orchestration_playbook.md – outlines three ingestion/orchestration patterns (local queue, serverless fetchers, batch jobs) and how to wire them into BenchmarkOSChatbot.
- Inline module docs across src/benchmarkos_chatbot/ describe invariants, data contracts, and extension hooks.
- Consider versioning your .env templates and deployment runbooks alongside these docs as the project evolves.

Happy building! 👋
