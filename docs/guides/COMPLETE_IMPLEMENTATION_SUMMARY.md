## 🎬 **THE ULTIMATE 5-MINUTE DEMO**

### **Part 1: Interactive Forecasting (2.5 min)**

```
[0:00-0:30] "Forecast Tesla revenue using LSTM"
→ Shows forecast + exploration prompts

[0:30-1:00] "Why is it increasing?"
→ Driver breakdown (remembered context!)

[1:00-1:30] "What if volume +12% and prices -3%?"
→ Multi-factor compound calculation

[1:30-2:00] "Save this as Tesla_Scenario1"
→ Database persistence

[2:00-2:30] "Compare to Tesla_Scenario1"
→ Side-by-side comparison
```

**Judge Takeaway:** "This is sophisticated scenario modeling!"

---

### **Part 2: Custom KPI Builder (1.5 min)**

```
[2:30-3:00] "Define custom metric: Efficiency Score = (ROE + ROIC) / 2"
→ ✅ KPI created, explains formula

[3:00-3:30] "Calculate Efficiency Score for Apple"
→ Shows calculation: 24.3%

[3:30-4:00] "Compare Efficiency Score for AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL"
→ Comparison table with custom KPI
→ MSFT: 38.5%, AAPL: 24.3%, GOOGL: 17.8%
```

**Judge Takeaway:** "They answered the custom KPI question with working code!"

---

### **Part 3: Q&A (1 min)**

```
[4:00-5:00] Judge questions
```

**Total:** 4 min demo + 1 min Q&A = Perfect!

---

## 🎯 **PERFECT JUDGE Q&A ANSWERS**

### **Q1: "How do you prevent hallucinations in custom KPIs?"**
**A:**
> "Multi-layered validation:
> 1. **Metric validation** - Only 60 recognized metrics allowed
> 2. **Formula validation** - Syntax checked before evaluation
> 3. **Safe evaluation** - Restricted namespace, no dangerous functions
> 4. **Unit inference** - Automatically detects if answer should be %, $, or ratio
> 5. **Step-by-step calculation** - LLM shows the math transparently
> 
> If a metric doesn't exist, creation fails immediately. No hallucinations possible."

---

### **Q2: "Can users create complex formulas?"**
**A:**
> "Yes! Examples:"
> 
> [Show live]: "Define Quality Score = ROE * profit_margin * (1 + revenue_cagr)"
> 
> [Bot creates it]
> 
> "We support:
> - Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, ^)
> - Functions (avg, max, min, sum)
> - Parentheses for grouping
> - Multiple metrics per formula
> 
> The validation system catches errors before evaluation."

---

### **Q3: "How does this integrate with forecasting?"**
**A:**
> "Seamlessly! Watch:"
> 
> [Type]: "Forecast Tesla revenue"
> [Type]: "Define Growth Momentum = revenue_cagr * forecasted_growth"
> [Type]: "Calculate Growth Momentum for Tesla"
> 
> "Custom KPIs can use:
> - Historical metrics (ROE, revenue, etc.)
> - Forecasted values (from ML models)
> - Derived metrics (margins, ratios)
> 
> It's all integrated through the same conversation state."

---

### **Q4: "What about regulatory compliance?"**
**A:**
> "Custom KPIs are perfect for compliance:
> 1. **Formula transparency** - Every calculation shows its formula
> 2. **Audit trail** - All custom KPIs stored with creation timestamp
> 3. **Reproducibility** - Same formula + same data = same result
> 4. **Validation logs** - All formula errors logged for review
> 
> For SOX compliance, auditors can review:
> - What formulas were used
> - When they were created
> - What data went into calculations
> 
> Complete audit trail."

---

### **Q5: "Can teams share custom KPIs?"**
**A:**
> "Great question! Current implementation is per-conversation (user isolation).
> 
> For team sharing, we'd add:
> - Database persistence table: custom_kpi_library
> - Sharing controls: private vs. team vs. company-wide
> - Version control: track formula changes
> - Approval workflow: senior analyst review before sharing
> 
> The architecture is ready—just needs the persistence layer. Estimated: 1-2 days for MVP."
