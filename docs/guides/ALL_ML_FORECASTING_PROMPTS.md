---

## 13. Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Be specific: `"Forecast Apple's revenue using LSTM"`
- Specify method: `"using LSTM"` or `"with Prophet"`
- Include time period: `"for the next 3 years"`
- Use company names or tickers: `"Apple"` or `"AAPL"` both work
- Ask follow-ups: `"Can you explain that more?"`

### ❌ AVOID:
- Too vague: `"Tell me about stocks"`
- Missing keywords: `"Apple's revenue"` (missing `forecast`/`predict`)
- Non-public companies: `"What about [private company]?"`
- Investment advice: `"What should I buy?"`

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

### If a forecast doesn't work:
1. ✅ Make sure you include a forecasting keyword (`forecast`, `predict`, etc.)
2. ✅ Specify a ticker (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, TSLA) or company name
3. ✅ Specify a metric (e.g., revenue, earnings)
4. ✅ Check that the company has historical data in the database (5+ years)

### Common Issues:
- **"No forecast generated"** → Company may not have enough historical data
- **"Method not available"** → Try a different model or use "auto"
- **"Generic snapshot instead of forecast"** → Make sure you use forecasting keywords

---

## 15. Notes

- ✅ Forecasts are generated fresh each time (not cached)
- ✅ Requires sufficient historical data (typically 5+ years)
- ✅ Different models work better for different types of data
- ✅ Ensemble method generally provides the most reliable forecasts
- ✅ **Regime detection and explainability are automatically included** - they enhance every forecast response
- ✅ Default time period is 3 years if not specified
- ✅ Default metric is revenue if not specified
- ✅ Default method is "auto" if not specified
