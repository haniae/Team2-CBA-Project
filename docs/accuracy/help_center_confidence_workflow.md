# Help Center Confidence Workflow

This workflow operationalises the verification process for every Help Center prompt family. Use it together with `docs/accuracy/help_center_verification_tracker.csv`, which holds the live tracker generated by `scripts/utility/generate_help_center_verification_tracker.py`.

## Daily Workflow
- **Refresh tracker:** Run `python scripts/utility/generate_help_center_verification_tracker.py` after updating prompt metadata to keep the tracker in sync.
- **Filter reds:** Open the CSV, filter `status = Unverified`, and assign owners for each prompt family.
- **Verify facts:** For each row, document the fact, metric definition, time frame, currency, and GAAP/Non-GAAP basis. Collect at least two primary sources with retrieval timestamps and paste supporting quotes in `discrepancy_notes`.
- **Update answers:** Adjust the response text to align with verified figures and paste the revised paragraph in `updated_text`. Change `status` to `Verified` and log the owner.
- **Resolve conflicts:** When sources disagree, explain the resolution in `discrepancy_notes`, include both citations, and capture any remaining risk.
- **Recalculate confidence:** Rerun the confidence scorer for the affected prompt family to confirm the penalties have cleared.

## Conventions Repository
- Fiscal year vs trailing-twelve-month (TTM) windows must be stated explicitly.
- Report all monetary values in USD unless the original filing demands otherwise; record the FX rate and date when converting.
- GAAP metrics should be paired with their non-GAAP counterparts only when the reconciliation is provided in the source material.
- Share counts must use the diluted weighted-average figure unless a specific scenario requires basic shares.

Update this document whenever new prompt families are introduced or methodologies change so the verification checklist remains current across the organisation.
